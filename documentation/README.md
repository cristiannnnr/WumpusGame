# Cybernetic Reinforcement Learning Agent for the Wumpus World

This repository contains all documentation, diagrams, and supporting files for the project **“Cybernetic Reinforcement Learning Agent for the Wumpus World Environment”**: Paper, Poster, Technical report and Slides for Catch-up presentation and more.

## 📘 Project Overview

This work explores the design of an autonomous agent that operates in a simulated **Wumpus World**, a well-known environment in artificial intelligence used to study decision-making under uncertainty.

The agent is developed using **deep reinforcement learning (DQN)** combined with principles from **cybernetics** and **system dynamics**. The core objective is to model intelligent behavior through feedback loops that allow the agent to adapt its actions based on environmental perception and structured rewards.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Custom Gymnasium-based Wumpus World environment
